.B metis
\- light, aesthetic, and useful personal task visualizer

.SH IMAGERY (see HERITAGE in man section 7 for more)
singularly graceful, stately, and regal with supreme gravitas

.SH SUMMARY
.B metis
is a aesthetic, keyboard-centric personal task visualizer with simple ascii
capture, consistent categorization, clean hierarchy for grouping, and meaningful
fields for sorting, searching and filtering.

.SH ASCII FILE
metis tasks kept in ascii files have two layers -- a grouping record and a
task record.  the file suffix should be ".tasks" for clarity.

.B grouping record , e.g., "<major> Д <minor>"
.nf
this allows the tasks to be grouped into a two layer heirarchy -- major
then minor.  both are text strings of 0 to 18 characters.

examples...
   metis              Д metis_data.c
   robotics           Д hexapod

.B detailed record , e.g., "<cats> Д <dest>"
.nf
the categories are each a single character representing urgency,
importance, estimate, progress, and a tbd/expansion char (see values below).
the description is a text string of 0 to 100 characters.

examples...
   tl1#и Д increase font sizes to fit current limits and show better
   dw1ии Д define task format when included in source file
   dw2>и Д all views make open/missing task slots transparent

major and minor groups are taken from the very last grouping record read and
added to the detailed task.

.SH SOURCE CODE FILE
when a metis task is kept in a source code file, the format is simplier.  to
build it, simply prefix the detailed record with "* metis Д " and the program
will be able to find it.

.B single line format
   /* metis Д tn1ии Д never allow MODE_NONE, must not pop last mode */

.B multi-line comment format
   /*
    * metis Д tn1ии Д never allow MODE_NONE, must not pop last mode
    */

.B major and minor groups
are automatically assigned as the program name and source code file
respectively.

.SH MASTER DUMP
in order to analyze or consolidate, the master dump puts all task information on
a single line, heedless of redundancy.  i chose not to break up the categories
to re-use existing design and code.

examples...
   major Д minor Д tn1<и Д and the description goes at the end
   major Д two   Д ww4ии Д and a second task goes here

.SH URGENCY
the urgency category assigns a preceived schedule to completion.
